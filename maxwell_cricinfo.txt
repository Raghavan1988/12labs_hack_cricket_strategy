<strong>Huge mix-up</strong> and that's that for Carey. Slower through the air outside off, slapped to cover. Maxwell just took a couple of steps forward but retreated as soon as he spotted Shadab get to the ball. But Carey was a long way down and the throw was spot on to the bowler

<b>timbeeeeeeeer! Maxwell loses his leg stump!</b> Big spin from Kuldeep and he's chopped in half trying to play off the back foot. Zipped through on the stumps, grips the pitch and veers back sharply to decapitate leg, plucked from the ground as Maxwell flailed across the line. Is that 220 out of the water?
In comes the skipper, Patty Cummins

Maxwell closes the face as Maharaj dips one into his toes, and <B>the leading edge pops straight back at the bowler!</B> That is surely game, set and match! Australia are in a whole heap of doo-doo as South Africa swarm towards their second win of the campaign!
Maxwell goes for an utterly becalmed 3 from 17, and well, is it just about preserving net run-rate from here? Stoinis might have other ideas for now...

good length ball around off. Flicked to midwicket where nobody's there. They try to take a second and it looks on... but Engelbrecht runs in from long on, picks up the ball with one hand, and then throws down the stumps at the bowler's end! Green isn't even waiting... he's walking as the umpires go upstairs! Oh the Dutch have fielded superbly today.

<B>out, but not before producing one of the most entertaining ODI centuries of all time!</b> Maxwell tries to go over long off but this time the ball came off the bat's outside half. Engelbrecht takes a tough catch near the boundary and Maxwell is undone by the wide line. However the TV umpire wants to check if the catch is clean. Ja, all good.
